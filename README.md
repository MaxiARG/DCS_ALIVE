# DCS_ALIVE

Bringing life to DCS: Intelligence, uncertainty, purpose.

This project is a DCS World mod, this is what I always wanted the game to be. The project's aim is to bring life to DCS World. I plan to do that by creating an ongoing war, capable of saving its state every tieme the player leaves the game. No external GUI, No sockets, no nothings, everything is LUA based on the Scripting engine and the awesome MIST api.

Uncertainty: You will never know what is going to happen next. You will never know if on your way back home, defenseless and Bingo fuel you will get attacked. You won't control what happens next. You won't be waiting to hit the trigger for any action to happen. Just like in real life, anything could happen, you won't be in control.

Intelligence:
There are going to be AI generals deciding what to do next, on both sides. Nothing is going to be pre-scripted. Generals and commanders deciding the next steps. Generals taking big decisions, and commanders taking smaller decision in the battlefield.

Purpose:
There are going to be enemy bases, supply lines, combat groups and many different kind of ground target, not just tanks, not just BMPs. There are going to be factories, buildings, bridges, roads, railways. There are going to be real world targets to attack and real world missions to acomplish.

There are going to be special events happening from time to time, to spice up the environment. Ambushes, sitting ducks and many more.

Purpose:
There is going to be a purpose to fight. Every target or mission you acomplish will have consequences. You destroy  an ammo depot? Armoured vehicles wont have ammo. They will need to get resupplies and missions will have to be scheduled. Every action counts.

Ultimately I will experiment with adding voiceless radio comms, but, a working, fluent and ongoing radio comms, so every human pilot gets the feeling that out there are other pilots thinking and doing stuff. The goal is to no feel alone in this world.

Final words:
There is a long way until you get something of value out of this project, so don't waste your time downloading it yet. This is just a work of love. I like to code, I like DCS and my playground is the Scripting Engine. Many of the things mentioned could change, mainly due to me learning new stuff, or unknown limitations of the API. Meanwhile, I keep the hopes is could be done.
